The currency market is an ever changing economy with prices that change on a minute basis. Although not as volatile as the stock market, it still allows skilled traders to make money. This bot will use many stock market indicators to evaluate the current position of the forex market and place orders to get an upper hand.

Around September 2020, we had the idea to create an AI that would evaluate the buy/sell value of the market, and buy in when necessary. This was working very well and we had many promising results, however we did not take into account the pattern day trading rule (PDT rule). The PDT rule stops traders with under $25,000 to place more than 3 orders in any given week in a margin account. This one rule stopped progress of the bot, as we were not allowed to evade these rules in an efficient way. After a long debate, we decided to switch our bot to trade currencies.
